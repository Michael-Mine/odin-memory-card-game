# Odin - Memory Card Game

A Memory Card Game you can play in your browser!

The cards are my favourite Studio Ghibli films - fetched from Studio Ghibli API https://github.com/deywersonp/ghibliapi

This is a React project from The Odin Project.

By building from scratch my second React application, this will help solidify my recent learning of React components, JSX, keys, props, state and effects.
